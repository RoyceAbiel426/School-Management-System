## 📝 Notes

### **CRITICAL: Implementation Dependencies (Updated Nov 25, 2025)**

**⚠️ STRICT IMPLEMENTATION ORDER:**

1. **School Profile Setup** - MUST be completed first (creates school_id, sets school type)
2. **Principal Profile** - Required after school setup
3. **Grade Creation** - Needed before classrooms and students
4. **Classroom Management** - Auto-created based on student count (30/class, max 5 sections)
5. **Student/Teacher/Course Management** - Can proceed after above
6. **Examination Setup** - MUST be created before results entry
7. **Results Entry** - Depends on exams being created

**Why This Order Matters:**

- School ID is used in student/teacher ID generation (`stu_XXX_schoolID`, `tch_XXX_schoolID`)
- School type (Boys/Girls/Mixed) validates student gender during registration
- Grades determine classroom sections (automatically A-E based on student count)
- Exams must exist before teachers can enter results
- Course modules are managed within course detail pages

### **Phase 1 Learnings**

- Feature-based folder structure scales well
- Context API is sufficient for current app size
- Service layer pattern works great for API calls
- Custom hooks improve code reusability
- Comprehensive documentation saves time

### **Considerations for Phase 2**

- **School Onboarding:** Implement wizard-style multi-step form for school setup
- **Grade & Classroom:** Auto-calculate sections based on student count (30 per class)
- **ID Generation:** Ensure school_id is available before creating students/teachers
- **Gender Validation:** Check school type before allowing student registration
- **Module Management:** Nested within course detail, not separate page
- **Exam Scheduling:** Calendar integration for exam dates
- **Attendance Deadlines:** Implement finalization system (auto-finalize after 15 days)
- Use react-hook-form for complex forms
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add loading states everywhere
- Consider using React Query for data fetching
- Keep components small and focused
- Write reusable form components first

### **Best Practices to Follow**

- Always show loading states
- Handle errors gracefully
- Provide user feedback (success/error messages)
- Validate on client and server
- Keep components under 200 lines
- Extract reusable logic to hooks
- Document complex logic
- Test critical paths
